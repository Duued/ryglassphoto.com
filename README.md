# ryglassphoto.com

This repository contains the website for [ryglassphoto.com](https://ryglassphoto.com), a photography portfolio showcasing the work of Ryan Glassman [@Duued](https://github.com/duued).

## Project Structure

I'm not going to go into  detail here. I don't want people hosting this as their own. If you figure it out, oh well.

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute, create a fork of the repository. You do not need actual photo images to test layouts. Put dummy images and name them according to the file structure.
Just know that I may be picky about some formatting and request changes. Assuming you don't completely overwrite everything, we can have an actual discussion about the changes.
