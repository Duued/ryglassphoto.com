                    eventually
                    sat still. When she sat still, I moved around to different angles, and this was my favorite angle.
                    This
                    was taken at my house, and she was laying on top of her cat tree, acting like she's looking down at
                    everyone in the house. I edited my photograph using the posturize to make it look partially like
                    it's
                    colored by a child using colored pencils. I wanted this photograph to look somewhat realistic, but
                    also
                    look like it was something that someone may have hand made themselves.</td>

                    found this angle. This photograph uses brightness and contrast. The contrast was increased slightly
                    to
                    increase the visibility of all the creases and details in the statue. I wanted to enhance a
                    creepiness
                    so I used these to make it look brighter.

                    this cage. I've taken several photos with the rats sticking out, and each time, the rat's were
                    moving around, until now. I didn't use any bait or treats to make them come out, I just tried taking
                    a photograph until it looked nice and clear. The rat looks realistic, while the background looks
                    somewhat hand-drawn.</td>

                    the glass was disgusting and looked horrible. This was my second shot at taking this photograph,
                    because at the time I was outside with my camera looking around at things that I would possibly want
                    to take a photograph of. Since I was the only one home, he was paying attention to me, so he looked
                    out the glass at me. This photograph was taken at my house.</td>

                    look at the trees. This was taken outside at Donegal High School. I made one edit, which was
                    removing the stop sign on the left side. This photograph was the third attempt to make a successful
                    leading lines photograph.

                    I chose the shutter speed to allow enough light to enter the sensor, and the ISO of 800 to make the
                    photograph bright enough.
                    This was taken in the photography room, at the backdrop wall. This was edited in photoshop by
                    recoloring the photograph, which

                    of 800. The shutter speed was chosen because the
                    light stick animation lasted for 5 seconds, and I wanted to be able to see the full effect and
                    animation. The ISO was chosen to allow for the photograph to be

                    was edited in photoshop by reducing the brightness of the photograph.

                    because I couldn't get it bright enough in the woodworking room. This was edited in photoshop by
                    making

                    by the camera. The ISO was set on 6400. Any less would have made the photograph very dark, and it
                    didn't need to be any higher. This photograph was edited in photoshop by changing the color balance,
                    and adding a cyan hue.

                air. The ISO was set at 800, because I wanted the photgraph to be bright, without making a very grainy

                    while I was taking photos. The shutter speed was chosen to allow the
                    light stick to be frozen as it was moving. The ISO was set at 800, because I didn't want it to be
                    super low, but I also didn't want it to be very large. This photograph
                    was edited by using camera raw, by decreasing the "temperature", highlights, and increasing the
                    shadows. The photograph had colored grain, so this was able to remove it.

                <td colspan="2">My series is about Nature, and different elements of nature.
                    I have chose this idea for my series becuase I wanted to be able to highlight different aspects of
                    nature and
                    outdoors. I originally wanted to just do skies, but I figured that may be hard to get pictures of,
                    so I went to do
                    nature in general, which included skies.
                    <br />&Tab;My goal for this project was to be able to exhibit different styles, using nature. I have
                    taken photos of plants,
                    trees, animals, and skies.
                    <br />I have exhibited being able to use shutter speed and aperture to my advantage. I was able to
                    freeze the different movement
                    of the plants, because most times I tried to take photos of plants, there was a slight breeze.
                    Composition allowed
                    for me to take more interesting photographs.
                    <br />I have learned how to use HDR to enhance photographs, and this style of photography allows for
                    there to be colors restored
                    in the photograph. To do HDR photography, you need to do the following steps
                    <ol style="list-style-position: inside;">
                        <li>Set up your tripod</li>
                        <li>Set your exposure settings correctly</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Take one photograph with correct exposure settings</li>
                            <li>Change the exposure settings to be one full level above correctly exposed and take
                                photograph</li>
                            <li>Change exposure settings to be one full level below correct exposure. Take the
                                photograph.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Go to Photoshop. Open all of your images.</li>
                        <li>File -> Automate -> Merge to HDR Pro</li>
                        <li>In the window that picks up, you can add them by adding them manually or clicking add opened
                            files.</li>
                        <li>Press Ok and wait for it to generate.</li>
                        <li>Edit the photograph and save normally</li>
                    </ol>
                    I think that my series came out great. I did make some mistakes with forgetting to change my
                    aperture, but it did make some
                    very unique photgraphs. Those photgraphs were edited to look better, but they did look decent
                    without the edits. I think that I should've checked my
                    settings more often, and made sure that everything was looking like it should've. I may have been
                    able to improve it by trying to get different
                    angles of the same subject. While I did move around for my photographs, I could've readjusted
                    completely in some of my photographs.

                    changed the aperture to a higher value.
                    This photograph was originally going to be an underexposed of an HDR, but I decided that I liked the

                    This photograph uses shallow DOF because the background is out of focus. This photograph was edited

                    giving the photograph an exaggerated shade of red. I liked the look of the photograph, but I wanted
                    to completely remove
                    the background. I wanted this to still count for the project so instead of removing the background I
                    kept it but made the rose have a different color
                    to help catch the eye and make it more interesting.

                    the photograph the photograph starts to get more blurry. This photograph was edited in GIMP, by
                    increasing the brightness
                    and the contrast. I changed some of the yellow from the photograph, and added contrast.

                    This photograph uses an aperture of f/29.0, a shutter speed of 1/8, and an ISO of 100. I wanted the
                    entire photograph to be in
                    focus, and I didn't want a grainy photograph. This uses a deep DOF because I wanted the photograph
                    to be a landscape. I made the
                    photograph grayscale because I wanted this photograph to look slightly different from the others in
                    the sense of having different colors.

                    is shallow DOF because I wanted the leaves in the foreground to be more visible than the leaves in
                    the background. I chose these settings to allow for a correctly exposed photograph.
                    This photo was edited in GIMP, and I increased the brightness and contrast to reveal more detail.

                    This photograph is shallow DOF because I wanted this to be similar to framing, because you are
                    looking through the background. I have modified my other settings to match a correct exposure.
                    to a much clearer part of the bush. This photogrpah was edited in GIMP by increasing the brightness
                    and contrast
                    to reveal more details.

                    This photograph uses a shallow DOF because I wanted the background to be blurred out. I have
                    picked these settings to allow for an underexposed photograph. This photograph was originally
                    going to be a part of an HDR photograph, with this being the underexposed. I wanted this photograph
                    to show the more details. I edited this photograph by increasing the contrast and slightly increasing the 
                    brightness.

                    This photograph uses a deep DOF because I wanted the entire photograph to be visible, however I wanted
                    to be able to look through the surrounding leaves to get to the Bird's nest. This photograph was edited in GIMP
                    by taking the area around the nest, and decreasing the contrast and brightness slightly, and increasing the 
                    contrast of the nest.
