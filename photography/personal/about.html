        <p>Hello! I am Ryan Glassman, a photographer. I have a huge passion for photography. I've been doing photography for 2 years now, and I enjoy photography. I also like to do computer-related hobbies such as programming and repairing computers.</p>
        <p>Throughout my work, I have various subjects that I am personally interested in, and/or I think are visually interesting. I work hard to ensure that all of my photographs fit nicely together and that they will be as visually pleasing as possible.</p>
        <p>While completing projects, I considered different angles, styles, compositions, and camera settings to mix up the photographs. This has allowed me to gain the most creative control over how my photographs turn out, and ultimately allow me to make my photographs fit together. This process has challenged me and led me to become a better photographer.</p>
